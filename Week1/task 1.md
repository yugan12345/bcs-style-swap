# objective of the task
to detect the edge of any given image

# experiments i did
for this task i used three different models that are sobel model scharr model and laplacian model
for the laplacian model i changed the threshold value to different values to get the best edge detection image
add for all the model i printed image with and without gaussian blur to comapre

# comparison
there is not much difference between the sobel and scarr method but the laplacian method produces a much better edge detection, and detects the edges which sobel and scharr fail to detetct
